## How does it work

What is included in this project?

1. Poetry pyproject.toml based python project
2. pre-commit hooks to manage the project and keep it in check
3. vscode settings to have IDE-based linting the same as hooks
4. makefile that automates all the above
5. production-ready dockerfile and dev-container
